# Room Messaging Overview

## Introduction

* Room message means that the user can send and receive broadcast messages in the room after entering the room by calling the SDK interface. The user will no longer receive messages from the room after exiting the room.
* Since the number of people in the room can be up to 300, 000, in the case of a particular large number of room messages are not guaranteed to be arrived 100%, but in general, room messages will not be lost. If you need to ensure that certain types of room messages can not be arrived 100% due to special circumstances, please contact us.
